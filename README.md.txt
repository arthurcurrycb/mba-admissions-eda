# 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis — MBA Admissions

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of an MBA admissions dataset. 

The goal is to investigate how variables such as GPA, GMAT, gender, work experience, and industry relate to admission decisions.

## 🔍 Objective

- Identify patterns between applicant characteristics and admission decisions.
- Generate hypotheses that could support strategic actions by the institution (even if fictional), such as reviewing selection criteria or improving diversity policies.
- Apply EDA best practices using Python and data visualization tools.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `mba_admissions_analysis_pt.ipynb`: complete notebook (written in Portuguese) containing all analysis steps: data loading, cleaning, univariate, bivariate, multivariate analysis, and conclusions.
- `MBA.csv`: original dataset used in the project.
- `README.md`: project overview in English.
- `README.pt.md`: project overview in Portuguese.

## 👤 Why this dataset?

I chose this dataset because of my professional background (I’ve worked in three edtech companies). 

This project simulates how educational institutions can use data to support decision-making in a realistic and insightful way.

## 🔗 Dataset source

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- (Planned) Seaborn
- (Planned) NumPy

## ✅ Next steps

- Implement a supervised predictive model (e.g., Decision Tree or Logistic Regression) to estimate admission likelihood based on candidate features.
- Refactor visualizations using Seaborn for better aesthetics and control over styling.
- Use NumPy for statistical calculations like Pearson correlation coefficient.
